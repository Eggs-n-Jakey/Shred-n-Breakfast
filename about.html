            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Shred and Breakfast was just an idea that started 20 years ago. Just a few kids that wanted to build an amazing place to live and grow. 
               The first interation of the house wasn't much at all. It was a Victorian house that we bought as a friend group. We slowly started to renovate the 
               space with the taste we had developed duriong our years in skateboarding. We realized how many friends we had accross the country that needed a place to stay.
               They were looking to get video parts and a lot of them were pros. This is how it began. We just started renting out rooms. As time went on we began with a mini ramp in
               the backyard. Then we converted the front steps of the house into a 5 set handrail. It kept growing and growing. Eventually we wanted to build something official. 
               Our community came together to build what we have today. A masterpiece in modern architecture. Today we are constantly booked up, we give priority to friends of the skateboard community
               that developed this cozy corner of the city.
            </p>
            <p>We might be a little chaotic but we have a plan. Breakfast is served at either 6am or 8am. During weekends we will plan a trip to one of the many local skateparks. We have a van to shuttle everyone.
                This helps people to network and gain new friends. 1 weekend a month we meet up with "Skate Dads" a local org whose mission is to nuruture the skate community at a young age. This helps us give back to the community
                by fostering youth into healthy outdoor activity. We also encourage our guest to consider volunteer work. We have adopted a section of 11 hwy. We take pride in our community. We take pride in our future. 
                We hope you can join us for the best B&B experience in the world!
